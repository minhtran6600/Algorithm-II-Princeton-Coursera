# Algorithm II - Coursera
I have self-taught myself fundamental Data Structures and Algorithm through the 2-course sequence Algorithm I and II taught by Prof. Robert Sedgewick and Lecturer Phillip Y. Goldman on Coursera. This repository contains the code of Data Structures and Algorithms taught in Algorithm II course, as well as the solution of each programming assignments.

## Course Structures
The course structure is provided below so that you can navigate the repositories:

### Week 1: Graph 
* **Undirected Graph**: Graph, Paths (Depth-first Search), Paths (Breadth-first Search), Cycle, Euler Cycle, Bipartite, Connected Components.
* **Directed Graph**: Directed Graph, Directed Breadth-first Search, Directed Depth-first Search, Topological Sort, Strong Components (Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm)
* **Programming Assignment 1**: Wordnet

### Week 2: Graph's Algorithm
* **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Edge, Edge (Weighted Graph), Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal Algorithm), Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm)
* **Shortest Path**: Directed Edge, Edge Weighted Directed Graph, DAG Shortest Path (Topological Sort), Bellman Ford's Algorithm, Djikstra's Algorithm

### Week 3: Graph's Algorithm (cont) and Introduction to String
* **Maxflow and Mincut**: Flow Edge, Flow Network, Maximum Flow (Folk-Fulkerson algorithm)
* **Radix Sort**: Key-indexed Counting Sort, LSD String sort, MSD String sort, 3-way String quick sort

### Week 4: String's Algorithm
